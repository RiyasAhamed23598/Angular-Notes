## What is angular?
- frontend Framework
- collection of tools and features

## Why Angular?
- write **declarative code**: define the target UI states & how they change and let Angular do the rest (instead of impertive: step by step instructions)
- separate concerns using custom HTML Elements (**components**). Break up complex applications into simple building blocks, split up responsibilities, re-use components. Better development process
- some of **Object-oriented programming** concepts and principles
- uses **TypeScript**
